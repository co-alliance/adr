# sites/all/modules

Splitting up your modules into logical directories will help you keep track of those modules that are part of the Drupal ecosystem, those that are in the Islandora ecosystem, and those that are either features, custom or patched.

This installation uses:

- sites/all/modules/contrib (for Drupal contrib modules)
- sites/all/modules/custom (for modules that you build, or that are built for you)
- sites/all/modules/features (for features used on site)
- sites/all/modules/islandora_contrib (for Islandora contrib modules not on drupal.org)
- sites/all/modules/islandora_patched (for Islandora contrib modules that have been patched)
- sites/all/modules/patched (for Drupal contrib modules that have been patched)

This structure is also used in site-specific directories.
